# Task Manager
Task Manager automatically tracks daily and weekly quests across all your alts. You choose what to track, and Task Manager will show you a list with a summary of characters that have completed each.

Getting started:
- Open the main window by clicking Task Manager in the addon compartment (top-right of the minimap, see screenshot below). You can also use the command /tm show
- Use the + button to add a quest you want to track. You can rename it and assign a category if you'd like.
- You can use the QuestID of hidden tracking quests, such as rares or treasures, as long as you can find the right ID
- NEW: You can also choose a boss kill to track. Currently you can only pick a boss from your recent raid/dungeon lockouts. Useful for mount or transmog farming!
- After adding new task(s), you will need to login to all your alts for their status to be updated

On the main window:
- The checkbox will show whether the current character has completed that task
- The numbers next to it will show how many alts have completed that task (not counting ignored characters)
- To edit or remove a task, right-click on it to get an options menu
- Click the task title to see a list of characters and completion status
- To ignore a character, right-click on it to get an options menu
